GenAI platform for the **FIFA World Cup 2026** that enhances both the fan
experience and venue operations at Estadio Azteca. Fans get multilingual,
grounded navigation, accessibility and transport help; organizers get live
crowd intelligence and AI-generated operational briefings for real-time
decisions.

## Chosen Vertical

**Smart Stadiums & Tournament Operations** (FIFA World Cup 2026), serving two
personas with one platform:

- **Fans** — a multilingual matchday assistant for navigation, accessibility,
  transport and venue questions (`/assistant`).
- **Organizers / venue staff** — an operations command center with live crowd
  density, incidents, sustainability metrics and AI decision support
  (`/operations`).

---

## Approach and Logic

1. **Ground the model, don't trust it.** Every Gemini call carries the
   authoritative venue dataset (gates, sections, facilities, transport,
   accessibility routes) in its prompt and is instructed to answer only from
   it. The assistant cannot invent a gate number — wrong wayfinding at a
   90,000-seat venue is worse than no answer.
2. **Decide from user context.** Each answer adapts to the question's language
   (five supported, validated at the boundary), and the grounded prompt
   instructs the model to lead with step-free routes and accessible options
   whenever a fan mentions a wheelchair, pram or reduced mobility. The briefing
   reads the _current_ live snapshot — zone densities, open incidents,
   sustainability trends — so recommendations change as the stadium state
   changes.
3. **Deterministic logic stays out of the LLM.** Crowd status
   (comfortable/busy/critical) is computed from occupancy thresholds in typed,
   unit-tested code; Gemini only turns the already-computed state into
   prioritized human recommendations. This keeps safety-relevant classification
   testable and repeatable.
4. **Fail closed and cheap.** Zod validates every input; errors map to one
   sanitized envelope; Gemini calls have timeouts, one retry and TTL caches so
   repeated questions don't re-bill or re-block.

---

## How the Solution Works

A fan (or organizer) opens the React client, served by the same Cloud Run
service that hosts the API. Questions go to `POST /api/assistant/ask`, where
zod validates the payload, the TTL cache is consulted, and a grounded prompt
(venue dataset + language + accessibility context) is sent to **Gemini 2.5
Flash**; the answer returns in the fan's language and is announced to screen
readers. The operations board polls `GET /api/operations/snapshot`, which reads
live zone/incident/sustainability state from **Firestore** (kept moving by a
telemetry simulator); "Generate AI Briefing" posts that snapshot to Gemini and
returns prioritized crowd, incident and sustainability actions. Full diagrams
and the request lifecycle are in [Architecture](#architecture) and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Assumptions Made

- **Venue dataset is static for the event.** Gates, facilities and transport
  for Estadio Azteca are curated in code (`server/src/features/stadium/`);
  a real deployment would source them from a venue CMS.
- **Telemetry is simulated.** No live turnstile/IoT feed exists, so a
  deterministic simulator writes realistic zone/incident/sustainability state
  to Firestore (disable with `TELEMETRY_SIM_ENABLED=false`); the read path is
  identical to production.
- **Public kiosk model — no accounts.** Both surfaces are anonymous and
  read-only toward venue systems, so no authentication is required
  (rate-limited instead); the operations board would sit behind staff SSO in
  production (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).
- **One stadium, five languages.** Scope is a single venue and the tournament's
  highest-traffic languages (en/es/fr/pt/ar); both are data, not architecture,
  and extend without code changes to routes or prompts.

## Features

- **Matchday Fan Assistant** (`/assistant`) — a multilingual chat grounded on
  the official venue dataset. Quick-action chips for the most common
  questions, a language selector, and answers that prioritize step-free and
  accessible options when mobility is mentioned.
- **Operations Command Center** (`/operations`) — a live board of zone crowd
  density, open incidents and sustainability metrics, refreshed on an
  interval, with an on-demand **AI Operations Briefing** that reads the
  current snapshot and returns prioritized recommendations.

---

## Architecture

Feature-folder monorepo (npm workspaces). Route handlers dispatch; feature
services hold logic; `lib/` holds pure, reusable utilities.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install (npm workspaces)
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env      # add your GEMINI_API_KEY

# 3. Run API (:8080) and client (:5173) in two terminals
npm run dev:server
npm run dev:client
```

Root scripts: `build` · `lint` · `typecheck` · `test` · `test:coverage` ·
`test:e2e` · `test:mutation` · `format`.

---

## Testing

Run `npm run test:coverage`. Coverage thresholds (95% lines, functions,
branches, statements) are enforced in each workspace's Vitest config, so CI
fails if coverage regresses; the suite currently measures **100% line coverage
in both workspaces**.

- **Server — 87 tests, 100% line coverage.** Unit tests for env validation,
  the TTL cache, the `AppError` type, the Gemini client (success, retry,
  sanitized failure), crowd/density logic, every middleware (validation,
  central error handling, static/SPA serving against a fixture build), and all
  feature services; zod schema boundary tests; full supertest integration
  tests covering every route, validation rejection, the sanitized 502 path,
  the hardened security headers, and the `/.well-known/security.txt`
  disclosure endpoint; plus a full matchday-journey test (health → venue →
  facilities → grounded answer → snapshot → briefing). Firestore is faked
  in-memory and Gemini is mocked for hermetic runs.
- **Client — 32 tests, 100% line coverage.** Testing Library tests for the
  full assistant flow (typed question, quick action, language passthrough,
  error state), the operations dashboard (live render, accessible density
  meters, snapshot error, briefing generation, in-flight double-request
  guard), lazy-loaded routing, the typed API client's error envelope
  handling, and the error boundary.
- **End-to-end — Playwright + axe-core.** Headless-Chromium smoke tests drive
  the critical fan-assistant and operations flows against the built client
  with the API mocked at the network boundary (`npm run test:e2e`), so they
  run hermetically in CI — and every flow ends with an **axe-core WCAG 2.1
  A/AA scan** that fails on any accessibility violation. A separate read-only
  live suite (`E2E_BASE_URL=<url> npm run test:e2e:live`, and the **E2E
  (live)** workflow) smoke-tests the deployed Cloud Run URL after each
  release.
- **Mutation testing — Stryker, ~91% score.** `npm run test:mutation` verifies
  the suite actually catches regressions rather than merely executing lines. It
  is scoped to the pure, deterministic domain logic (crowd/telemetry math, the
  TTL cache, the error model, async plumbing); the I/O-bound services and routes
  are covered by the supertest integration tests instead. It runs on its own
  non-blocking schedule.

---

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

- **Secrets** in Google Secret Manager, mounted via `--set-secrets`; nothing
  sensitive in the repo, image or git history. CI runs a gitleaks scan.
- **Input validation** with strict zod schemas at every boundary; unknown
  keys rejected, assistant question length-capped.
- **HTTP hardening**: Helmet with a restrictive CSP, an explicit CORS origin
  allowlist, a 100 kB JSON body limit, and layered rate limits (general +
  stricter on the Gemini endpoints).
- **Error hygiene**: one central handler returns sanitized `{ code, message }`
  bodies; stack traces and internal detail are logged server-side only.
- **Supply chain**: `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` → 0
  vulnerabilities, enforced as a CI step on every push; lockfile committed.
  Dependabot opens grouped weekly update PRs for npm and GitHub Actions.
- **Static analysis**: GitHub CodeQL (`security-extended` query pack) scans the
  code on every push, on pull requests, and weekly.
- **Least-privilege CI**: every workflow requests only `contents: read`.
- **Coordinated disclosure**: a vulnerability contact is published at
  [`/.well-known/security.txt`](https://arenaiq.com/.well-known/security.txt)
  (RFC 9116), served by an explicit route in
  [`server/src/middleware/security.ts`](server/src/middleware/security.ts).

---

## Performance

- Route-level code splitting: each persona page is lazily loaded, so the
  initial route ships ~78 kB gzip of JavaScript.
- `compression()` on responses; long-lived `Cache-Control` on content-hashed
  assets, `no-cache` on the HTML shell.
- Module-scope Gemini and Firestore clients reused across requests; every
  Gemini call has a timeout and one retry.
- In-memory TTL caches for repeated assistant questions and briefings.
- `--min-instances=1` keeps a warm instance for a sub-2s first response.
- **Lighthouse: Performance 100 and Best Practices 100 on the home route,
  Accessibility 100 on every route** of the live URL (Lighthouse 12.8.2;
  per-route scores and the reproduction command in
  [docs/lighthouse-results.md](docs/lighthouse-results.md)). Live API timings:
  snapshot ~0.4 s, assistant ~1.8 s, cached briefing ~0.3 s.

---

## Accessibility

Built to **WCAG 2.1 AA** and verified with axe and Lighthouse.

- Semantic landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`), a skip link, and one `h1` per
  route.
- Every control has a programmatic label; the app is fully keyboard operable
  with visible focus rings.
- Live regions (`aria-live`) announce assistant answers and briefings;
  density is exposed as an accessible `meter` with a descriptive label.
- Status is never colour-only (text tags accompany every colour); contrast
  meets 4.5:1 for text; `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured.
- Multilingual answers are marked up correctly: each answer carries
  `dir="auto"` and a `lang` attribute (WCAG 3.1.2), so Arabic renders
  right-to-left and screen readers use the right phonetics — proven by a
  dedicated Playwright test asserting computed `direction: rtl` on real
  Arabic content.
- `jsx-a11y` rules enforced in lint; every E2E flow ends with an **axe-core
  WCAG 2.1 A/AA scan** that fails the suite on any violation.
- **Lighthouse Accessibility 100** on every route (home, `/assistant`,
  `/operations`) with zero audit failures — see
  [docs/lighthouse-results.md](docs/lighthouse-results.md). Lighthouse's
  accessibility audits run the axe-core ruleset; status colours were tuned to
  meet the 4.5:1 contrast bar.
